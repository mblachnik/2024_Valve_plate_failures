# Scripts used to perform experiments for valve plate failure predictions in pistom pump hydraulic systems

The script requires:
* downloading the data from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbjunior/valve-plate-failure-prediction-in-hydraulic-pumps
* On kaggle is available script which creates the datasets
* It is also available in the main.py script except that you have to download the files manually.

This script was used to obtain results presented in:
